# 0x1B. Radix Sort
## Radix sort

Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm

- Prototype: `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- Must implement the `LSD` radix sort algorithm
- Assume that `array` will contain only numbers `>= 0`
- Allowed to use `malloc` and `free` for this task
- Youâ€™re expected to print the `array` each time you increase your `significant digit`
